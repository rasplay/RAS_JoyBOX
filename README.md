## Known Bugs ##
If you try to read or write on i2c with a tool like i2cget or i2cset when the driver is loaded, you are gonna have a bad time... 

If you try i2cdetect when the driver is running, it will show you strange peripheral addresses...

256MB Raspberry Pi Model B is not supported by the current driver. If you want to make the driver work on your old RPi, you will have to change the address of BSC1_BASE to (BCM2708_PERI_BASE + 0x205000) in order to use the correct i2c address, and recompile.
